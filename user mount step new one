This is a deeper Windows permissions and service context issue. Even with file permissions set correctly, there are several Windows-specific factors preventing the mount from working for user Mahesh. Here's a comprehensive solution:

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue isn't just file permissions - it's about:
1. **User session isolation** in Windows
2. **WinFsp driver access** across user sessions
3. **Service/process elevation** requirements

## Proper Solution Steps

### Step 1: Verify WinFsp Installation
```cmd
# Run as Administrator
winfsp-x64.msi /quiet INSTALLDIR="C:\Program Files (x86)\WinFsp"
```
Ensure WinFsp is installed system-wide, not just for Administrator.

### Step 2: Create a System Service Approach
Create a new batch file `system-s3mount.bat`:

```batch
@echo off
# Kill any existing rclone processes
taskkill /f /im rclone.exe 2>nul

# Wait a moment
timeout /t 3 /nobreak >nul

# Mount with system-wide visibility
rclone mount s3:yourbucket S: ^
  --config="C:\rclone\rclone.conf" ^
  --vfs-cache-mode writes ^
  --vfs-cache-max-size 100M ^
  --allow-other ^
  --file-perms 0777 ^
  --dir-perms 0777 ^
  --network-mode ^
  --daemon
```

### Step 3: Modify Task Scheduler Configuration
1. **Delete existing task** and recreate with these settings:
   - **General Tab:**
     - Name: `S3Mount-SystemWide`
     - Use account: `SYSTEM`
     - Run whether user is logged on or not: ✓
     - Run with highest privileges: ✓
   
   - **Triggers Tab:**
     - At startup (not at logon)
   
   - **Actions Tab:**
     - Program: `C:\rclone\system-s3mount.bat`

### Step 4: Alternative - User-Specific Mount
If system-wide doesn't work, create user-specific setup:

1. **Log in as Mahesh**
2. Create scheduled task while logged in as Mahesh:
```cmd
schtasks /create /tn "S3Mount-Mahesh" /tr "C:\rclone\s3mount.bat" /sc onlogon /ru "Mahesh" /rp "MaheshPassword"
```

### Step 5: Registry Permissions Fix
Run as Administrator:
```cmd
# Give Mahesh access to WinFsp registry keys
icacls "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WinFsp.Launcher" /grant Mahesh:F
```

### Step 6: Folder Permissions Fix
```cmd
# Set proper permissions on rclone folder
icacls "C:\rclone" /grant Mahesh:(OI)(CI)F /T
icacls "C:\rclone" /grant Users:(OI)(CI)RX /T
```

### Step 7: Test Method
Create `test-mount.bat` for Mahesh:
```batch
@echo off
echo Testing mount as %USERNAME%
rclone version
rclone listremotes
rclone mount s3:yourbucket S: --config="C:\rclone\rclone.conf" --vfs-cache-mode writes --allow-other --network-mode
pause
```

## Alternative Solution: Use Shared Network Drive
If the above doesn't work, use this approach:

1. **Mount on one machine as Administrator**
2. **Share the mounted drive over network:**
   ```cmd
   net share S3Drive=S: /grant:Mahesh,FULL
   ```
3. **Map network drive on Mahesh's session:**
   ```cmd
   net use Z: \\localhost\S3Drive /persistent:yes
   ```

## Debugging Steps
Run these as Mahesh to diagnose:
```cmd
# Check if WinFsp is accessible
fsutil fsinfo drives

# Check rclone config access
rclone config show

# Check mount permissions
mountvol
```

Try the **Step 3 system-wide approach first** - this usually resolves the user isolation issue. If that doesn't work, use the user-specific approach in Step 4.
