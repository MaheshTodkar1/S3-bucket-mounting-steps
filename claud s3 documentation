# Mount Amazon S3 Bucket on Windows - Simplified Guide

## Overview

This guide demonstrates how to mount an Amazon S3 bucket as a Windows drive using only Rclone and WinFSP, with automatic hidden mounting on user login through Windows Task Scheduler.

## Prerequisites

### AWS Requirements
- An S3 bucket (e.g., `mt-s3-demo-mount-bucket`)
- An IAM user with programmatic access (Access Key & Secret Key)
- Proper IAM policy attached to the user allowing:
  - `s3:ListBucket`
  - `s3:GetObject`
  - `s3:PutObject`
  - `s3:DeleteObject`
  - `s3:ListAllMyBuckets` (if needed)
- Bucket must not have explicit deny in its policy

### Required Tools

1. **Rclone**: Connects your Windows system to your Amazon S3 bucket
2. **WinFSP**: System driver that allows Windows to mount cloud storage as a drive
3. **Windows Task Scheduler**: Built-in Windows service for automated task execution

## Initial Setup

### Step 1: Install WinFSP
Download and install WinFSP from the official website: https://winfsp.dev/rel/

### Step 2: Download and Configure Rclone
1. Download Rclone from: https://rclone.org/downloads/
2. Configure Rclone with your S3 credentials using `rclone config`

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create a Dedicated Rclone Folder

1. Open File Explorer
2. Navigate to C: drive
3. Create a new folder named `rclone`

You now have:
```
C:\
└─ rclone\
```

### Step 2: Setup Rclone Files

Copy both these files into `C:\rclone`:
- `rclone.exe` (from your Rclone download)
- Your working `rclone.conf` (from `%USERPROFILE%\.config\rclone\rclone.conf`)

Final structure:
```
C:\rclone\
├── rclone.exe
└── rclone.conf
```

### Step 3: Create the Mount Batch Script

1. In `C:\rclone`, right-click → New → Text Document
2. Rename it (including extension) to: `mount-s3.bat`
3. Right-click `mount-s3.bat` → Edit → paste exactly:

```batch
@echo off
REM -- Change these values if your remote or bucket differs
set REMOTE=my-s3
set BUCKET=mt-s3-demo-mount-bucket
set DRIVE=S:

REM -- Mount command; do NOT close this window if run manually
"C:\rclone\rclone.exe" mount %REMOTE%:%BUCKET% %DRIVE% --vfs-cache-mode full --network-mode
```

4. Save and close Notepad

Your folder now looks like:
```
C:\rclone\
├── mount-s3.bat
├── rclone.conf
└── rclone.exe
```

### Step 4: Test Your Batch Script Manually

1. Double-click `mount-s3.bat` in Explorer
2. A console opens; after a moment, you should see a new S: drive in "This PC"
3. Open a text file on S:, edit, save in place—confirm it works
4. Close the console window to unmount

**Important**: Once this manual test passes, you know the script is correct.

### Step 5: Create the Hidden Run VBScript

1. In `C:\rclone`, right-click → New → Text Document
2. Rename it to: `mount-s3-hidden.vbs`
3. Right-click `mount-s3-hidden.vbs` → Edit → paste exactly:

```vbscript
' ===== mount-s3-hidden.vbs =====
Set WshShell = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
' Arguments: 0 = run hidden, False = do not wait for completion
WshShell.Run """C:\rclone\mount-s3.bat""", 0, False
```

4. Save and close

Now your `C:\rclone\` folder contains:
```
C:\rclone\
├── mount-s3.bat
├── mount-s3-hidden.vbs
├── rclone.conf
└── rclone.exe
```

### Step 6: Set Up the Task Scheduler Job

1. Press `Win+R`, type `taskschd.msc`, press Enter
2. In the Actions pane, click **Create Task...** (not "Basic Task")

#### General Tab
- **Name**: `Mount S3 Drive`
- **Description**: `Automatically mount S3 bucket on login, hidden.`
- **Security options**:
  - Select "Run only when user is logged on"
  - Check "Run with highest privileges"

#### Triggers Tab
- Click **New...**
  - **Begin the task**: At log on
  - **Settings**: Any user (or pick your username)
  - **Delay task for**: 30 seconds
  - Click **OK**

#### Actions Tab
- Click **New...**
  - **Action**: Start a program
  - **Program/script**: `wscript.exe`
  - **Add arguments (optional)**: `"C:\rclone\mount-s3-hidden.vbs"`
  - **Start in (optional)**: `C:\rclone`
  - Click **OK**

#### Conditions Tab
- Uncheck anything you don't want (e.g., "Start only if on AC power")

#### Settings Tab
- Check "Run task as soon as possible after a scheduled start is missed"
- Check "If the task fails, restart every 1 minute, up to 3 times"
- Ensure "Allow task to be run on demand" is checked

3. Click **OK** to save the task

### Step 7: Final Verification

1. Log off your Windows session or reboot the PC
2. Log back in
3. Wait ~30 seconds
4. Open File Explorer → This PC → you should see S: mounted
5. Double-click a text file on S: → edit → Save. It should overwrite in place with no prompts

**Congratulations!** Your S3 bucket now behaves as a fully editable, hidden, auto-mounting drive every time you log in, with zero console windows and no service account headaches.

## Configuration Customization

### Changing Remote/Bucket Names
Edit the variables in `mount-s3.bat`:
```batch
set REMOTE=your-remote-name
set BUCKET=your-bucket-name
set DRIVE=S:
```

### Changing Mount Drive Letter
Simply change the `DRIVE` variable to any available drive letter (e.g., `Z:`).

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Drive not appearing after login:**
- Check Task Scheduler → Task Scheduler Library → find "Mount S3 Drive"
- Right-click → Run to test manually
- Check the "Last Run Result" column for error codes

**Permission denied errors:**
- Verify your AWS IAM policies are correctly configured
- Ensure your `rclone.conf` contains valid credentials

**Files not syncing properly:**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify S3 bucket permissions
- Try remounting by running the VBScript manually

**Task Scheduler not running:**
- Ensure "Run with highest privileges" is checked
- Verify the file paths in the Actions tab are correct
- Check Windows Event Viewer for detailed error messages

### Log Files and Debugging

To enable logging, modify your `mount-s3.bat` file:
```batch
"C:\rclone\rclone.exe" mount %REMOTE%:%BUCKET% %DRIVE% --vfs-cache-mode full --network-mode --log-file "C:\rclone\mount.log" --log-level INFO
```

## Benefits of This Solution

- **Minimal Dependencies**: Only requires Rclone and WinFSP
- **Hidden Operation**: No visible console windows during operation
- **Automatic Mounting**: S3 bucket mounts automatically on user login
- **User-Level Operation**: Runs under user context, avoiding service complications
- **Reliable**: Task Scheduler handles failures and retries automatically
- **Full File Access**: Complete read/write access to S3 files as local files

## Security Best Practices

- Store AWS credentials securely in the rclone configuration
- Regularly rotate your AWS access keys
- Use least-privilege IAM policies for your S3 access
- Monitor S3 access logs for unusual activity
- Consider encrypting sensitive files before uploading to S3
