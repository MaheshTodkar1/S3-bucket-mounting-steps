**Yes, starting fresh with a new EC2 Windows instance is actually a smart approach** given the complexity of Windows permission issues you're dealing with. Here's why and how to do it properly:

## Why Fresh Start Makes Sense
1. **Clean slate** - no conflicting permissions or registry entries
2. **Proper setup sequence** - install everything in the right order
3. **Avoid Windows permission hell** - these issues can be very time-consuming to debug
4. **Test with target user from beginning** - set up as "Mahesh" user from start

## Fresh Setup Strategy

### Phase 1: EC2 Instance Setup
1. **Launch new Windows Server 2019/2022 instance**
2. **Create user "Mahesh" immediately** after first login as Administrator
3. **Add Mahesh to Local Administrators group** (temporarily for setup)

### Phase 2: Software Installation (Do as Mahesh)
```cmd
# Login as Mahesh, then install:
1. Download and install WinFsp as Mahesh user
2. Download and install rclone as Mahesh user
3. Create rclone config as Mahesh user
```

### Phase 3: Mount Setup (Stay as Mahesh)
Create this simple approach - no hidden scripts needed initially:

**mahesh-s3mount.bat**:
```batch
@echo off
cd /d C:\rclone
rclone mount s3:yourbucket S: --config rclone.conf --vfs-cache-mode writes --network-mode
```

### Phase 4: Task Scheduler (Create as Mahesh)
1. **Login as Mahesh**
2. Open Task Scheduler
3. Create task with:
   - Run as: **Mahesh** (not Administrator)
   - Trigger: At logon of Mahesh
   - Action: Run `mahesh-s3mount.bat`

### Phase 5: Test & Iterate
- Test mount manually first
- Then test via task scheduler
- Add background/hidden execution later once basic mount works

## Alternative: Skip EC2, Use This Minimal Approach

If you want to try one more fix on current system:

### Clean Slate Method (Current Instance)
```cmd
# 1. Remove all existing scheduled tasks
schtasks /delete /tn "YourCurrentTask" /f

# 2. Login as Mahesh, create new rclone folder
mkdir C:\rclone-mahesh
cd C:\rclone-mahesh

# 3. Copy rclone.exe and config here
copy "C:\rclone\rclone.exe" .
copy "C:\rclone\rclone.conf" .

# 4. Create simple mount script
echo rclone mount s3:yourbucket S: --config rclone.conf --vfs-cache-mode writes > mount.bat

# 5. Test manually first
mount.bat
```

## My Recommendation: Fresh EC2 Instance

**Go with the fresh EC2 instance** because:
- Takes 30-60 minutes total setup time
- Eliminates all permission debugging
- You'll have a clean, documented process
- Can easily replicate on other instances
- No risk of existing Windows permission conflicts

Would you like me to provide step-by-step commands for the fresh EC2 setup? Or do you want to try the minimal clean slate approach on your current instance first?
